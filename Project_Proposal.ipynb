    "Goal: Create a training set to classify whether or not a female undergraduate student in nursing who enrolled to university at age 18 and gained a 60% and 70% grade in their first and second semester, respectively, in their first year.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step One: Tidy & Wrangling Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the **select()** function, select only the columns needed to answer the predictive question, which are Gender, Age at enrollment, Curricular units 1st sem (grade), and Curricular units 2nd sem (grade).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the **filter()** function, select only the observations/rows of students who are in nursing (course is nursing). \n",
    "Using the same function, filter out rows with \"Enrolled\" as the Target (the unwanted label for analysis). \n",
    "\n",
    "Using **!is.na**, remove all na values in each of the chosen columns.\n",

    "\n",
    "Train the training data set by: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the **recipe()** function, creating a recipe specifying the label and predictors' columns and standardizing the data set to ensure all data are in a comparable scale that contribute equally to k-nearest neighbor calculations. \n",
    "2. Using the **nearest_neighbor()** function, specify the model (k-nearest neighbor) with tuning on the number of neighbors \n",
    "3. Using the **vfold_cv** funciton, perform a 5-fold validation to evaluate the accuracy of the classifier of each k value\n",
    "4. Using the **workflow()** function, create a workflow analysis with the created recipe, model specification, cross-validation model as well as with 10 k values and the tune_grid function to fit the model for each k value. \n",
    "5. Using the **collect_metrics** function, collect the means (estimated accuracies) of classifiers with different k values\n",
    "6. Using the **filter()** function, filter rows/observations with \"accuracy\" for .metric to only consider the means (estimated accuracies) of the classifiers.  \n",
    "7. Plot a mean vs neighbor number graph to visually predict the optimum k value for training the training set. \n",
