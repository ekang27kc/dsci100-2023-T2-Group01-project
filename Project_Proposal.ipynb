    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Attending university is an important stage of our academic journey. However, not every student is able to obtain a degree for higher learning, in which their dropout can be caused by a variety of factors. Predicting chances for academic success can be extremely vital towards the future of both the student and university, in the consideration of whether the student should continue their studies. The dataset “Predict students' dropout and academic success” determines different factors that contribute towards students’ graduation and dropout rate such as students’ gender, marital status, nationality, classes taken, credits enrolled, and grades received. Our goal in this project will be to answer the question “Which factors are significant in determining the success of students in a University level education?”   

    "From Rubric: \n",
    "*Provide some relevant background information on the topic so that someone unfamiliar with it will be prepared to understand the rest of your proposal\n",
    "Clearly state the question you will try to answer with your project\n",
    "Identify and describe the dataset that will be used to answer the question*\n",
    "\n",
    "- also include where and when the study was done (if u can find them in their paper) \n",
    "\n",
    "Question: Can gender, age of enrollment, sem1grade, and sem2grade predict whether or not an undergraduate students will be a dropout or a graduate? \n"

    "## Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Choosing Predictors\n",
    "Four characteristics that may predict whether or not an individual will be a graduate or a dropout were chosen. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Gender\n",
    "Many studies have shown that females are more likely to graduate with a degree than males.  *(source: https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2021/10/08/the-male-college-crisis-is-not-just-in-enrollment-but-completion/)* \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Age at Enrollment\n",
    "Differences in experience and maturity of older ages may contribute to better academic performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1st & 2nd Semester Grades (2 predictors)\n",
    "Grades may be a huge predictor, as low grades are likely to influence a student's decision of dropping out. \n",
    "Also, a low grade in the first semester and a huge improvement in the second semester and vice versa could lead to an interesting prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to see if these predictors do indeed predict whether or an individual will be a graduate or dropout. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Tidying & Wrangling Data\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select the 4 columns/predictors of interest in the data set, and rename them to a more human-readable form. \n",
    "2. Filter out the rows with \"Enrolled\" as the Target variable since it is an unwanted label for analysis. Also, filter out NA values in the data set. \n",
    "3. Since Target is the chosen label, convert the Target vector to a factor from a character\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.Training Data + Selecting Parameter Value\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Split the tidied data set into a training and testing dataset \n",
    "2. Creating a recipe specifying the label and predictors' columns and standardize the training dataset to ensure all data are in a comparable scale that contributes equally to k-nearest neighbor calculations\n",
    "3. Using the K-nearest neighbor algorithm, tune the model in order to pick the best K value \n",
    "4. Perform a 5-fold validation to evaluate the accuracy of the classifier of each k value\n",
    "5. Perform a workflow analysis to fit the model for each k value (of chosen number of k values). \n",
    "6. Collect the estimated accuracies of each classifier created and create a scatter plot graph to choose the optimum K value for training the training set\n",
    "7. Retrain the training dataset with the chosen K value \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Evaluating Accuracy of Training Dataset + Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Test the trained model with the testing dataset. \n",
    "2. By comparing its predictions and true labels from the original dataset, obtain the classifier's accuracy. \n",
    "3. Determine if the chosen four predictors do indeed predict whether a student will be a graduate or a dropout. \n"
